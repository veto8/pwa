## Manifest
* User can create an Account
* User Alice creates a Transfer Request to a specific Zone.
* The System tries to connect to Users of this requested Zone when they have as well a request to Alice Zone.
* Example: Alice has a transfer Request to Bob's Zones.
* Alice and Bob are now connected, and they need to build Trust and agree to the transferred amount.
* After Trust is established, Amounts, Accounts and Exchanges are mutally agreed.
* Alice sends the amount to Bob's destination account.
* Bob sends to Alice's Destination account.
* Expensive inter-zones transfer fees are avoided.
